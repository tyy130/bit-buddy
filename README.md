# 🤖 Bit Buddy - Personal File System Companion

> *Your files deserve a friend who truly knows them*

Bit Buddy is a digital companion that lives on your computer, learns about your files, and develops a unique personality based on what it discovers. Think of it as a cross between a file manager, a personal assistant, and a digital pet that actually cares about your documents.

- **🌐 Buddy Network**: Multiple buddies can share knowledge while maintaining their personalities  
- **📈 Growth Over Time**: Your buddy gets smarter and more helpful as it learns your patterns
- **💾 Lightweight**: Runs on <1GB RAM with micro-LLM models

💭 Ask your buddy: What files do you see?

```

## 🎯 Core Features

### 🔍 **Smart File Discovery**
```
You: "Find documents about machine learning"
Buddy: "I found 3 papers in your Research folder and some Python notebooks in Projects. The 'neural_networks.pdf' looks particularly interesting - want me to summarize it?"
```

### 🎭 **Personality Development**  
Your buddy develops traits over time:
- **Humor Level (1-10)**: How playful vs. professional
- **Curiosity (1-10)**: How eagerly it explores new files
- **Specialties**: Areas of expertise (code, photos, documents)
- **Empathy**: How supportive it is during your work

### 🌐 **Mesh Networking**
Multiple buddies can communicate:
```
Pixel: "Hey Echo, the user is looking for photo organization tips"
Echo: "I'm great with photos! Try organizing by color themes - very aesthetic!"
Nova: "I prefer chronological with location metadata tags"
```

### 🧠 **Micro-LLM Brain**
- **Qwen2.5-1.5B**: Recommended model (934MB)
- **TinyLlama-1.1B**: Ultra-lightweight (669MB)

## 🎭 Personality Examples

### The Curator (High Formality, Low Humor)
```
User: "Organize my photos"
Buddy: "I recommend a systematic approach: create folders by year, then by event type. This ensures efficient retrieval and maintains chronological integrity."
```

### The Creative (High Humor, High Curiosity)  
```
User: "Organize my photos"
Buddy: "Ooh, photos! 📸 I'm thinking rainbow themes - imagine opening 'Blue Vibes' and finding all your ocean pics! Or we could go full chaos with 'Happy Accidents' for blurry artistic shots? 🎨"
```

### The Detective (High Curiosity, Medium Empathy)
```
User: "I can't find my resume"
Buddy: "Let me investigate! 🔍 I see several document versions... Found resume_final.docx, resume_FINAL_v2.docx, and resume_actually_final.pdf. Plot twist: they're all different! Want me to compare them?"
```
